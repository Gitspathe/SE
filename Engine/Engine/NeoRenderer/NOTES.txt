TODOs:

- Figure out which uniforms are engine specific, and set them appropriately
- Figure out how vertex buffers will work with Materials
  - Might be better to you assume the layout (all sprites have the same vertex buffer layout)

DON'T WORRY ABOUT THIS UNTIL LATER:
 - How will resources be cleaned up? I.e, a texture or material should be disposed, how will that all work??
