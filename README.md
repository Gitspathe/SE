# Spaghetti Engine (WIP)
SE is a 2D game engine, built over MonoGame.

## Installing the Source
1. `git clone https://github.com/Gitspathe/SE`
2. Change the current CLI directory to the folder which was just created (SE), and run `git submodule update --init --recursive`
3. Open SELauncher, change the configuration platform to x64, and build.

NOTE: Installation is still WIP!
